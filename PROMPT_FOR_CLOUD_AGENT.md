## Task

Please read and implement the complete specification in:
- **SPRINT_12_UNIVERSAL_SKILL_SYSTEM.md** (main specification - 2,000+ lines)
- **SKILL_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md** (background context)

## Overview

This sprint transforms Writers Factory into an intelligent multi-agent platform where:
1. All 6 Explants Claude Skills are accessible through the UI
2. Intelligent orchestrator routes to best available provider
3. Writers can create their own custom skills without coding

## Two Phases

### Phase A: Foundation (22-25h estimated)
Implement Tasks 12-01 through 12-07:
- **Task 12-01**: MCP Skill Bridge (4h) - Connect all 6 Explants Claude Skills
- **Task 12-02**: Skill Orchestrator (4h) - Intelligent routing system
- **Task 12-03**: Native Scene Analyzer (5h) - First Python implementation
- **Task 12-04**: Backend API Endpoints (2h) - Expose via REST
- **Task 12-05**: Frontend Integration (3h) - Craft Panel UI
- **Task 12-06**: Reference Migration (2h) - Copy knowledge materials
- **Task 12-07**: Testing & Documentation (2h)

### Phase B: Democratization (8-10h estimated)
Implement Tasks 12-08 through 12-10:
- **Task 12-08**: Skill Creation Wizard Backend (4-5h)
- **Task 12-09**: Custom Skill Executor (3h)
- **Task 12-10**: Wizard UI Components (4h)

## Success Criteria

Sprint 12 is complete when ALL Phase A tasks work:
- [ ] All 6 Claude Skills callable via MCP Bridge
- [ ] Orchestrator routes correctly
- [ ] Native Scene Analyzer works
- [ ] API endpoints functional
- [ ] Craft Panel UI working
- [ ] Can analyze real Explants scene end-to-end

Phase B is bonus - focus on Phase A first!
