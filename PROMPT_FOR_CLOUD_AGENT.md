## Next: Sprint 13 - Novel Intelligence System

**THE Game-Changer Feature**

Please read and implement:
📄 **SPRINT_13_NOVEL_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM.md** (2,763 lines)

This builds an AI-powered novel analysis and knowledge graph system.

### Phase A: Core Pipeline (15-20h estimated)

**Task 13-01: Manuscript Ingestion (3h)**
- Parse DOCX, PDF, Markdown, existing projects
- Split into chapters, scenes, paragraphs
- Extract metadata

**Task 13-02: Entity Extraction (6-8h)**
- Character Extractor (names, traits, psychology, arcs)
- Location Extractor (settings, world details)
- Plot Thread Tracker (setup, development, resolution)
- Motif & Theme Analyzer (metaphors, symbols, themes)
- Timeline Builder (sequence, causality)

**Task 13-03: Knowledge Graph Construction (4-5h)**
- Build graph from extracted entities
- Nodes: characters, locations, motifs, themes, events
- Edges: relationships, timeline, causality
- Query interface

**Task 13-04: Automated Analysis Pipeline (4-5h)**
- Batch scene scoring (use Sprint 12 Scene Analyzer)
- Character consistency checking
- Plot hole detection
- Pacing analysis
- Metaphor distribution analysis

**Task 13-05: Strategic Plan Generator (2-3h)**
- Priority matrix (P0-P3)
- Actionable fixes
- Effort estimates
- Implementation order

### Phase B: Interactive UI (10-12h estimated)

**Task 13-06: Graph Visualization (5-6h)**
- D3.js force-directed graph
- Interactive exploration
- Node/edge rendering
- Filters and search

**Task 13-07: Natural Language Queries (3-4h)**
- "Show me all scenes with Mickey and Noni"
- "Track casino metaphor usage"
- "Find unresolved plot threads"
- Query parser + graph traversal

**Task 13-08: Analysis Dashboard (2-3h)**
- Scene scores overview
- Character consistency matrix
- Pacing heatmap
- Metaphor domain charts
- Priority issues list

## Success Criteria

Sprint 13 complete when:

**Phase A:**
- [ ] Can upload/ingest manuscripts (multiple formats)
- [ ] Extracts characters, locations, plots, motifs accurately
- [ ] Builds queryable knowledge graph
- [ ] Runs automated analysis (integrates with Sprint 12 skills)
- [ ] Generates strategic rewrite plan with priorities

**Phase B:**
- [ ] Interactive graph visualization works
- [ ] Natural language queries return relevant results
- [ ] Dashboard displays all metrics beautifully
- [ ] Performance acceptable (< 5 min for 100k words)

**Critical Test:**
- [ ] Can analyze The Explants Volume 1 (136 scenes)
- [ ] Identifies known issues (Act II casino saturation, etc.)
- [ ] Generates useful strategic plan
