Hi Cloud Agent! 👋

I need you to build Sprint 1 + 2 of the Writers Factory web UI.

📖 **READ THESE FIRST**:
1. CLOUD_AGENT_SPRINT_1_2.md (comprehensive guide with all code)
2. CLOUD_AGENT_QUICK_START.md (TL;DR version)

🎯 **YOUR MISSION**:
Build a Cursor AI-style web interface (React + Vite + Monaco Editor) that connects to the existing FastAPI backend.

✅ **BACKEND ALREADY WORKS**:
- FastAPI at webapp/backend/simple_app.py
- 23 AI models configured
- Real AI integration complete (not mock!)
- 156 tests passing
- Manuscript structure models ready

❌ **WHAT'S MISSING** (your job):
- VS Code-style 3-pane UI
- Manuscript Explorer tree (Acts → Chapters → Scenes)
- Monaco markdown editor with autosave
- AI Tools panel
- Knowledge query panel
- Tournament compare grid

🎨 **DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**:
- Keep it SIMPLE (like Cursor AI)
- Dark theme, text-focused
- NO fancy graphics or colors
- Professional writer's tool

📋 **SPRINT 1** (do this first):
- S1-01: React + Vite scaffold with 3-pane layout
- S1-02: Manuscript Explorer + add 3 backend endpoints
- S1-03: Monaco Editor with autosave
- S1-04: Setup Wizard

📋 **SPRINT 2** (do after Sprint 1):
- S2-01: AI Tools tab (Generate/Enhance/Continue)
- S2-02: Knowledge tab (Cognee/NotebookLM)
- S2-03: Tournament Compare (2-4 models side-by-side)

⏱️ **TIMELINE**: 5-7 days total

📁 **LOCATION**:
- Create NEW frontend at: webapp/frontend-v2/
- Don't touch existing frontend (backup)
- Add 3 endpoints to: webapp/backend/simple_app.py
- Don't modify factory/ or tests/ (already working)

🧪 **TESTING**:
- Run pytest tests/ -v (should show 156 passing)
- Build frontend: npm run build
- Test locally: npm run dev → http://localhost:5173

✅ **DONE WHEN**:
- User can navigate Acts → Chapters → Scenes
- Click scene loads in Monaco editor
- Autosave works (2s idle + Cmd+S)
- Generate/Enhance calls real AI
- Tournament compare shows 2-4 outputs
- Knowledge query works for both sources
- Everything feels clean and simple (Cursor AI style)

📞 **QUESTIONS?**
- Check CLOUD_AGENT_SPRINT_1_2.md for detailed code
- Check PHASE_3_REVIEW.md to see what's already built
- Check COMPLETE_INVENTORY.md for system overview

**Let's build something writers will love!** 🚀

Start by reading CLOUD_AGENT_SPRINT_1_2.md, then create your feature branch and begin with S1-01 (React scaffold).
