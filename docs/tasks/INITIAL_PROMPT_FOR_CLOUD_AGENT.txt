Please read the START_HERE.md file in the docs/tasks/ directory of the writers-factory-core repository.

This contains your complete instructions for implementing the full Writers Factory system - a multi-model AI novel writing tool with 5-stage workflow (Creation → Writing → Enhancing → Analyzing → Scoring).

Your mission:
1. Read START_HERE.md and PROMPT_Cloud_Agent_Master_Instructions.md
2. Complete all 7 tasks sequentially (detailed specs in TASK_*.md files)
3. Commit and push after each task completion
4. Don't wait for approval between tasks - work autonomously
5. When all tasks complete, create a final report summarizing your work

Key points:
- You have full read/write/push access to writers-factory-core repository
- Work autonomously - make decisions when specs are ambiguous
- Write tests for everything
- Follow the commit message format in master instructions
- Target timeline: 2-3 weeks total

Tasks to complete in order:
1. Storage & Session Management (3-4 hours)
2. Master CLI - Rich TUI (4-5 hours)
3. Knowledge Router (3-4 hours)
4. Workflows Module (4-5 hours)
5. Model Comparison Tool (3-4 hours)
6. Creation Wizard (6-8 hours)
7. Integration & Polish (2-3 hours)

Success criteria: All 23 checkpoints from the rebuild prompt must be met.

Begin with Task 1 and work through to Task 7. Report back when complete with a summary of all commits, tests written, and success criteria met.

Let's build something amazing! 🚀
