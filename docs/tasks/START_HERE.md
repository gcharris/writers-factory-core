# START HERE: Writers Factory Implementation

Welcome! You're about to implement the complete Writers Factory system.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Read This First
📄 **PROMPT_Cloud_Agent_Master_Instructions.md** - Your master instructions for all 7 tasks

### 2. Understand the Vision
📄 **PROMPT_Cloud_Agent_Rebuild.md** - Deep dive into the hybrid architecture

### 3. Implement Each Task (In Order)

Work through these sequentially, pushing after each completion:

1. **TASK_Storage_Session_Management.md** (3-4 hours)
   - File-based JSON storage, auto-save, cost tracking, crash recovery

2. **TASK_Master_CLI.md** (4-5 hours)
   - Rich TUI implementation, 5-stage navigation, status bar

3. **TASK_Knowledge_Router.md** (3-4 hours)
   - Cognee + NotebookLM integration, intelligent query routing

4. **TASK_Workflows_Module.md** (4-5 hours)
   - Scene generation, enhancement, voice testing workflows

5. **TASK_Model_Comparison_Tool.md** (3-4 hours)
   - Repurpose tournament as side-by-side model comparison tool

6. **TASK_Creation_Wizard.md** (6-8 hours)
   - Conversational questionnaire, 5 phases, Save the Cat! 15 beats

7. **Integration & Polish** (2-3 hours)
   - End-to-end testing, documentation, performance optimization

## Work Protocol

**For each task**:
1. ✅ Read the task document thoroughly
2. ✅ Implement the functionality as specified
3. ✅ Write unit tests + integration tests
4. ✅ Commit with descriptive message (see format in master instructions)
5. ✅ Push to `writers-factory-core` repository
6. ✅ Continue immediately to next task - **don't wait for approval**

---

## Your Autonomy

You have **full autonomy** to:
- Make implementation decisions when specs are ambiguous
- Choose appropriate libraries and patterns
- Refactor existing code as needed
- Document assumptions and proceed

**Do NOT wait for approval between tasks.** Keep moving forward.

---

## When You're Done

Create a final report (template in master instructions) summarizing:
- All commits pushed
- Success criteria met (23 total)
- Tests written and passing
- Known issues or assumptions
- Recommended next steps

---

## Questions?

If truly blocked:
1. Check the task documents for details
2. Review the rebuild prompt for architecture context
3. Check the UX spec (`docs/UX_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md` in writers-factory-core)
4. Document your assumption and proceed
5. Only ask if genuinely blocked on a critical decision

---

## Timeline

**Estimated**: 2-3 weeks total
- Week 1: Storage + Master CLI (foundation)
- Week 2: Knowledge Router + Workflows + Model Comparison
- Week 3: Creation Wizard + Polish

---

## Success Criteria

All 23 criteria from the rebuild prompt must be met:
- Core Functionality (5)
- Knowledge System (4)
- Writing Workflows (3)
- Model Comparison Tool (4)
- Creation Wizard (4)
- Session Management (3)

## Repository Access

- **Repository**: `writers-factory-core`
- **Your Access**: Full read/write/push
- **Branch**: Work on `main` or create `feature/full-implementation`
