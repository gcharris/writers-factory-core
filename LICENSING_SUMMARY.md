## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Can I still make money from Writers Factory?
**A**: YES! Apache 2.0 explicitly allows commercial use. You can:
- Offer hosted versions
- Sell premium features
- Provide consulting
- License to enterprises

### Q: Do contributors get paid?
**A**: Not automatically. Contributors:
- Get credit and recognition
- Retain ownership of their code
- Can use contribution for portfolios
- May be hired for paid work later

Some projects later offer bounties or revenue sharing, but that's optional.

### Q: What if I want to close-source a feature?
**A**: You can create proprietary features that integrate with the open-source core, as long as:
- Core remains Apache 2.0
- Proprietary code is separate
- You're not violating the license

### Q: Can someone fork and compete?
**A**: Yes, that's the nature of open-source. They can:
- Fork the codebase
- Create competing service
- Modify and redistribute

But they must:
- Keep Apache 2.0 license
- Give you credit
- Can't use your trademarks

**Defense**: Build a strong brand, community, and commercial offerings.

### Q: What about The Explants novel?
**A**: Your novel is YOURS. Apache 2.0 only covers the software. Your creative works remain under your full copyright.
